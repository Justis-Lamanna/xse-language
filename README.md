# xse-language
Mini-library for the XSE Language specification

A library containing a language definition for XSE, also known as eXtreme Scripting Editor, created by Hackmew. This is used
in an attempt to create language support in VSCode, but may be useful for a variety of other things.

As of now, the intention of this library is for documentation-based purposes only, to be used by code completion and other features of
the Language Server Protocol. Thus, a command should not hold any functionality, such as compilation/decompilation rules.

`XseLanguage.V1` is the current language defintion, to be used in other programs.
